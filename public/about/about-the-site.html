          <h1>About the Site</h1>
          <p>
            This site was created in February of 2024 after I had a bout of inspiration looking at other Neocities pages. All the design and coding is done by myself. The code for the page is
            <a href="https://github.com/petracoding/petrapixel.neocities.org" target="_blank">available on GitHub</a>. Feel free to browse around, but please don't steal large chunks of code (or judge
            me for bad code quality...). For more credits please visit the <a href="/about/credits.html">credits page</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>The purpose</b> of this site is to serve me as a creative project as well as a showcase of my work (such as art, playlists, and so on), and all my blathering.
            <img aria-hidden="true" src="../img/inline/smirk.gif" /> Some of the content is taken straight from my <a href="https://listography.com/petra1999">listography profile</a>, because that's
            where I keep most of my stuff online.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>The content</b> of this site is ok for teens and up, but I might link to external mature content (such as songs and movies). Some pages of this site might contain triggering content (in
            the form of gory images), but these have a warning at the top!
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>The design</b> of this site is a deliberate protest against modern web design trends, because I fricking hate them. <img aria-hidden="true" src="../img/inline/quiet.gif" /> Let's make
            the web fun again!
          </p>
