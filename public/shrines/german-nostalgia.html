          <h1>German Nostalgia</h1>
          <p>
            I am in the process of making <abbr title="A webpage dedicated to something">shrines</abbr> for some nostalgic stuff from my childhood! Click on any of the links below to visit the
            shrines. They are in German, but if you don't understand it you can still look at all the pictures! <img aria-hidden="true" src="../img/inline/excited.gif" />
          </p>
          <br />
          <strong>The Shrines:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="/shrines/ravensburger-kinderwelt.html">Ravensburger Kinderwelt</a>: an online game from ~2005-2010 for children aged 6 to 12, contained a lot of <i>Ravensburger</i> product
              placement, such as games, puzzles and books. Almost no information on it is available online (only 1 article and some screenshots!), so it's almost as if it never existed. The point of
              this shrine is to collect as much information (and memories) on it as possible, so that those who also loved it as children can partake in some sweet, sweet nostalgia!
              <i>Shrine work-in-progress!</i>
