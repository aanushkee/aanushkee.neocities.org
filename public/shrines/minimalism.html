        <p>
          I truly believe that becoming just a little bit more minimalist can have amazing positive effects on anyone. But always remember: there's no need to be a perfect minimalist now. Becoming
          more minimalist is a process that will never be over. Don't rush, and try to build habits instead of trying to tick of all boxes immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember to dispose of your things responsibly. Give away or donate as much as possible, sell what you can, and recycle the trash. For clothes specifically you can check if your city has a
          "clothes swap party" - those are great to get rid of clothes but also get some new pieces!

        <h2>10 tips:</h2>
        <ol class="declutter-list declutter-list--first">
          <li>when decluttering use marie kondō's method: ask yourself "does this spark joy?"</li>
          <li>if it's not a "hell yes i need this" it's a "i don't need this"</li>
          <li>always wait a month before buying something you want but not need. you might change your mind.</li>
          <li>only buy what fits in the containers (e.g. box, wardrobe, ...) you already have, don't buy new containers</li>
          <li>identify and avoid triggers: if one app/site/ad/etc makes you want to buy stuff, avoid it — social media detox! <span</li>
          <li>you don't need to own things in stock or just in case: it's easy and quick to buy things these days. if you do need it, or you run out, then you can buy it in 1-2 days max.</li>
          <li>before getting rid of things put them into a box and hide it for a few months. after the time is up you can keep what you actually needed, and get rid of everything else</li>
          <li>if you get rid of items that require more items, it's easy to get rid of a lot at once (e.g. a tv and its cables and tv stand and remote)</li>
          <li>one in, one out: only buy a new item if you get rid of an item of that category first (e.g. get rid of a jacket before you buy a new one)</li>
          <li>take pictures of everything before getting rid of it: this way, you can keep the memory</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>"Where do I even start...?"</h2>
        <p>Here are some practical tips for beginners.</p>
        <ol class="declutter-list declutter-list--first">
          <li>get rid of trash (e.g. expired beauty products, dried-out pens, bedsheets with holes, ...)</li>
          <li>get rid of things you have twice / multiple times</li>
          <li>get rid of things you only own to seem cool</li>
          <li>
            declutter your closet. this is usually one of the biggest "trashpiles"! get rid of everything that isn't your size, everything you don't enjoy wearing, and everything you haven't worn in a
            year.
          </li>
          <li>ask companies to send you emails instead of letters</li>
          <li>
            scan all your physical documents and instruction manuals (you can do it with your phone! i recommend using the Goodle Drive app for this.) and only keep physical copies those of which you
            need originals
          </li>
        </ol>
