It's not the same story that you might know from 'Silence of the Lambs', but takes place earlier in Hannibal Lecter's life. The main character of the show is Will Graham, who helps the FBI catch serial killers. He soon meets Hannibal Lecter, a psychologist, and (kind of) befriends him. That's all I'm going to say to the plot... /// The show is one of the best tv shows I've ever seen. It might be slow-paced at times, and the language used is very flowery, but something about it is so good that it will never ever leave my brain. The best thing about the show is without a doubt the relationship of Will and Hannibal, and how it changes over the seasons. Beware, though: The show is very gorey and brutal at times, so it's probably not for you if you're squeamish. Also, it was unfortunately cancelled after 3 seasons.</p><p>Below is a quote from the show. Click the "<span style="font-family:serif">+</span>" to show another quote.
