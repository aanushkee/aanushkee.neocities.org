          <h1>Vocabulary <img aria-hidden="true" src="../img/inline/star.gif" /></h1>
          <p>
            <b>I love learning new English words.</b> I'm an english student, writer, and not a native speaker. Knowing more words gives me the freedom to better express myself, and to understand the
            world better! <img aria-hidden="true" src="../img/inline/happy.gif" />
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes I study vocabulary about a specific topic, e.g. clothing, pirates, and the judicial system. But most of the time I just study those that I have come across while reading and
            watching TV/movies; I always write down words that I don't know or am not sure of. <img aria-hidden="true" src="../img/inline/yes.gif" />
          </p>
          <p>
            To study the vocabulary I use <a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/">vocabulary.com</a>, a wonderful site that makes it very easy to create vocab lists (you can paste entire e-books into it
            and it will pick out the difficult words!) and fun to learn the words! I also love the way they give definitions, because the descriptions are funny and memorable. This is starting to
            sound like an ad, so I'll stop. <a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/profiles/A01LYN0RH04WMH">Here's my profile.</a> I have 1,592,070 points at the time of writing and have learned over
            1,000 words (and surely forgotten at least half of them).
          </p>
          <p>
            To revise vocabulary I have studied before I usually export the words from vocabulary.com (<a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/470272-vocabulary-com-export"
              >using my own userscript</a
            >) and import them into <a href="https://quizlet.com/">Quizlet</a>, which is a flashcard site/app that I also love using for studying for Uni.
          </p>
          <p>
            When organizing my vocabulary lists I usually use 3 tools:
            <s
              >One is <a href="https://www.helperset.com/tools/remove-duplicates-from-list">this site</a>, which removes duplicates from your list. Another is
              <a href="https://sortmylist.com/">this site</a> which can sort lists alphabetically.</s
            >
            I have now made myself my own <a href="https://petracoding.github.io/vocabulary-manager.html" target="_blank">vocabulary manager</a> for all the tasks listed above. And lastly, I use
            vocabulary.com, as mentioned, because with it you can sort your vocabulary lists by difficulty of word, which is pretty awesome! (If you want more helpful links like this you can check out
            my <a href="/resources/bookmarks.html">bookmarks page</a>.)

            These are unsorted words which I learned after reaching English level C1. This means they are <b>intermediate or advanced</b>. If you spot a word that sounds very easy I probably mean an
            alternative definition. <img aria-hidden="true" src="../img/inline/laughing.gif" />
