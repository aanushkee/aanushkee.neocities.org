  <h1>Webringu</h1>
  <p>Webringu is a super simple, easy-to-use and customizable webring script so you can create your own webring today! :) I also use it <a href="/webring">for my own webring</a>.</p>
  <p>
    The name 'Webringu' is inspired by the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(film)" target="_blank" title="Horror warning!">Ringu (1998)</a> (which is the Japanese original of 'The
    Ring').
  </p>

  <p>Please link back to this page if you use Webringu for your webring. I appreciate it!</p>

  <h3>What it does (and doesn't)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Webringu is super easy to use. It doesn't require any JavaScript knowledge beyond editing a simple members array.</li>
    <li>Webringu will work for free Neocities accounts (for both you and your members).</li>
    <li>Webringu doesn't require your webring's members to include a bloaty script or CSS file on their site.</li>
    <li>Webringu gives you complete freedom for how the webring widget looks.</li>
    <li>Webringu provides you with <b>next</b>, <b>previous</b> and <b>random</b> links to use in your widgets.</li>
    <li>You can edit Webringu's code to your liking if you know what you're doing.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    But... Webringu <b>doesn't</b> update your members list automatically. You have to do that manually in the code. However, it can then automatically output the members list on your page. This way,
    you only have to keep one member list up-to-date (the one in the code).
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>How To Use</h2>
  <h3>Your Code</h3>
  <p>
    First, create a page for your webring which will have all its information, rules, members list, etc. It does not matter whether this is a whole website on its own or just a singular page on your
    own website.
  </p>
  <p>On that page, use this code:</p>

  <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;script&gt;
  // List of members. You need to update this by hand. Slugs need to be unique and without special characters or spaces.
  const members = [
    {
      url: &quot;https://example0.com/&quot;,
      title: &quot;Example0&quot;,
      slug: &quot;example0&quot;,
    },
    {
      url: &quot;https://example1.com/&quot;,
      title: &quot;Example1&quot;,
      slug: &quot;example1&quot;,
    },
  ];
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://petrapixel.neocities.org/assets/js/webringu.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

  <blockquote class="warning">
    <p>
      <b>If you have a free Neocities account:</b> You won't be able to use an external script. Instead,
      <a href="https://petrapixel.neocities.org/assets/js/webringu.js" target="_blank">download it</a>, name it <code>webringu.js</code>, upload it to your website and use it like so:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;script src=&quot;/your-path-here/webringu.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>The rest of Webringu will work like normal.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    You will have noticed that every member has something called a <b>slug</b>. That's just a unique ID that includes no special characters, perferibly written in all lowercase. For example
    <code>petrapixel</code>. You can let your members choose their own slug or assign one to them yourself - whatever your preference.
  </p>

  <p>You need to keep the <code>members</code> array updated, e.g. when a new member joins, when someone leaves, when someone's URL changes, etc.</p>

  <hr />

  <h3>Member's Code</h3>
  <p>Now, assuming your webring page is <code>https://your-webring-page.neocities.org/webring</code> you can give the members of your webring a code that looks something like this:</p>

  <div class="my-webring-widget" style="margin: 30px 0 35px">
    <a href="https://your-webring-page.neocities.org/webring"><b>Your Webring Name</b></a
    ><br />
    <a href="https://your-webring-page.neocities.org/webring?slug=YOURSLUGHERE&action=previous">previous</a>
    <a href="https://your-webring-page.neocities.org/webring?slug=YOURSLUGHERE&action=random">random</a>
    <a href="https://your-webring-page.neocities.org/webring?slug=YOURSLUGHERE&action=next">next</a>
  </div>

  <p>This is the code for the widget:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div class=&quot;my-webring-widget&quot;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://your-webring-page.neocities.org/webring&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your Webring Name&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://your-webring-page.neocities.org/webring?slug=YOURSLUGHERE&amp;action=previous&quot;&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://your-webring-page.neocities.org/webring?slug=YOURSLUGHERE&amp;action=random&quot;&gt;random&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://your-webring-page.neocities.org/webring?slug=YOURSLUGHERE&amp;action=next&quot;&gt;next&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

  <p>
    Obviously, add your real webring page URL and name (or image) in there. You can use arrows for the <i>next/previous</i> links (e.g. <span style="font-family: Arial">⤻ ⤺ → ← » « ⇨ ⇦</span>). You
    can remove the random link if you don't need it, and you can style the widgets however you want. I recommend simple styling that is achievable with inline CSS only; This way, your members don't
    have to add a CSS file to their site just to display the widget. But really, you're free to do whatever you want as long as the URLs are correct.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Tell your members to replace YOURSLUGHERE with their slug</b> (unique ID). Otherwise the links will NOT work. To make sure your members know their slug it's a good idea to include it in your
    members list. (Webringu's automatic output (see below) includes it, of course.)
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h3>Optional: Members List</h3>
  <p>If you want an automatic table of your members outputted on your webring page, just add this element:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div id=&quot;webringulist&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;Please enable JavaScript to view the member list.&lt;/noscript&gt;</code></pre>
  <p>In this element, a table with all members will be rendered. It will look something like this:</p>

  <div id="webringulist" style="margin: 30px 0">
    <table class="webring-members">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Member</th>
          <th>Website</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><abbr title="example0">Example0</abbr></td>
          <td><a href="https://example0.com/">example0.com</a></td>
          <td>Example Description</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><abbr title="example1">Example1</abbr></td>
          <td><a href="https://example1.com/">example1.com</a></td>
          <td>Example Description</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><abbr title="example2">Example2</abbr></td>
          <td><a href="https://example2.com/">example2.com</a></td>
          <td>Example Description</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p>The description column is only showed if in use. Slugs are displayed when hovering over a member's name/title.</p>
  <p>Website buttons will be displayed if the member has a "buttonUrl" property, like so:</p>
  <p>You can style this table however you want.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>To output the number of members in the webring, use <code>&lt;span id=&quot;webringucount&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code>, e.g.:</p>

  <pre><code class="language-html">This webring has &lt;span id=&quot;webringucount&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; members.</code></pre>
