  <h1>My Game Dev Journey</h1>
  <i class="fa-solid fa-gamepad"></i>
  <p>I decided I <i>finally</i> want to learn how to make video games! This page is for anyone who wants to go on that journey with me, or who is just interested!</p>
  <p>I am using the free game engine <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot</a> to make a 2D game.</p>
  <p>
    <b>YMMV</b>: Keep in mind that I have some experiencing coding (especially JavaScript and Java). Though I do have to learn a new language for Godot (GDScript), but it's a very easy language to
    learn! Also, I have a LOT of free time to do stuff like this, and only worked on it on free days, so if you follow along don't feel pressured to do it as the same pace as me!

  <h2>Day 1</h2>
  <h3 data-step="1">Deciding on a Game Engine</h3>
  <p>
    On day 1 I knew I had to decide on a game engine before doing anything else. After researching a bit, I decided to use the free game engine
    <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot</a>. I chose it because it's supposed to be easy for beginners, can be used to create 2D as well as 3D games, and can export games for PC,
    Mobile Phones and the Web! It honestly almost seems to good to be true!
  </p>

  <h3 data-step="2">Downloading Godot</h3>
  <p>
    I <a href="https://godotengine.org/download/windows/" target="_blank">downloaded Godot</a> (no installation necessary!) and then downlaoded and took the free
    <a href="https://www.gdquest.com/tutorial/godot/learning-paths/godot-tours-101/" target="_blank">Godot Tour</a> to get familiar with Godot's UI. This only took a few minutes and I already felt
    less overwhelmed after doing it! The step is optional but it's so quick that I do recommend it.

  <br />
  <p>This step is also when I started taking <b>notes</b>. Whenever I thought "Oh, I should remember that" I wrote it down.</p>

  <h3 data-step="3">Learning GDScript</h3>
  <p>
    Now it was time to learn GDScript, Godot's coding language. I read through <a href="https://gdquest.github.io/learn-gdscript/" target="_blank">Learn GDScript From Zero</a>, which is a free
    interactive tutorial that covers the very basics of GDScript. Most of it was already familiar to me because I have experience coding, and GDScript is not much different than other programming
    langauges. However, I did learn some valuable Godot-specific things, especially in lessons 7, 10, 11, 15, 21, 24, and 26. I skipped most of the 'practice' parts because they weren't much of a
    challenge for me. If you're a total beginner to coding I definitely recommend doing them though!

  <p>
    All in all, going through the tutorial took me about an hour. I don't know everything, but I've got the basic syntax down, which is the basis I was looking for. I added some of the new stuff I
    learned to my notes, so that I wouldn't have to go through the tutorial again.

  <h2>Day 2</h2>
  <h3 data-step="4">Setting Goals</h3>
  <p>
    I knew I needed a way to keep track of the skills I have and the ones I still have to learn, so I decided to write a list of what I want to learn. I already had an idea for a simple first game
    that I kept in mind while writing the list. At the end, the list looked something like this:
  </p>
  <details>
    <summary>Show/Hide</summary>
    <p><b>Things I want to know how to do:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>How to add text / button to the UI</li>
      <li>How to add things to the UI programmatically</li>
      <li>How to make things happen on click/hover</li>
      <li>How to switch between scenes (e.g. Menus)</li>
      <li>How to make game settings</li>
      <li>How to make text appear on screen (as if typed out)</li>
      <li>How to get user text input</li>
      <li>How to make a pause menu</li>
      <li>How to make things happen on keyboard input</li>
      <li>How to make things happen on mouse movement</li>
      <li>How to save game data / state</li>
      <li>How to add sound effects</li>
      <li>How to add background music</li>
      <li>How to add volume sliders</li>
      <li>How to animate things in the scene/UI</li>
      <li>How to move around a character</li>
      <li>How to make a character jump</li>
      <li>How to make a character collect things</li>
      <li>How to deal with screen resolution, window size, etc</li>
      <li>How to export a game for Windows</li>
      <li>How to test game performance</li>
      <li>How to test the game in general</li>
      <li>How to do version management</li>
      <li>How to add Steam support (e.g. achievements)</li>
      <li>How to do Input Remapping</li>
      <li>How to export a game for Mobile</li>
      <li>How to export a game for Web</li>
      <li>How to get your game on itch.io or Steam</li>
    </ul>
  </details>
  <br />
  <p>
    I knew that I will have to expand this list later due to the <a href="https://agilecoffee.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/14-dunning-kruger.jpg" target="_blank">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>, but for
    now it looked good.
  </p>

  <h3 data-step="5">Tutorial Time!</h3>
  <p>
    Well, at this point I had procrastinated enough and it was time to actually start making a game. I looked around for a good video tutorial I could follow along with and found
    <a href="https://youtu.be/LOhfqjmasi0" target="_blank">How to make a Video Game - Godot Beginner Tutorial</a> by <i>Brackeys</i>, which seemed to be one of the most popular and best tutorials for
    Godot beginners. It was 10 months old when I watched it, and some things changed between the Godot version used in the tutorial and the current one I was using, but the comments were very helpful
    for dealing with these differences.

  <p>
    I watched the video and created the game alongside with it. I took my time, taking a break after every two chapters or so. I also made sure to take ample notes, so I wouldn't have to go back to
    the video as often and could just consult my notes instead.
  </p>
  <p>
    The tutorial is only a bit over an hour long, but it probably took me a few hours to go through it once and create the game as shown in the tutorial. Weirdly, writing my own notes was what took
    the longest; creating the game really did not take that long.
  </p>
  <p>The feeling of achievement when I had for the first time in my life created a playable game (well, more accurately, the start of the first level of a game) was great!</p>

  <h2>Day 3</h2>
  <h3 data-step="6">Doing it all over again</h3>
  <p>
    I knew that having made the game once alongside with the tutorial wasn't enough, so I decided to do the <b>same</b> project <b>again</b> but this time <b>without</b> viewing the video again. This
    way, I tested how much information I had retained (and how good my notes were).
  </p>
  <p>I played around until I felt comfortable repeating the steps in the tutorial on my own, and even added some new elements.</p>
  <p>And would you look at that - I could cross out some stuff from my "What I want to learn" list!</p>
