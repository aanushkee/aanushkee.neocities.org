        Unfortunately, if you have a free website on neocities created after ~2022 you are not allowed to use external scripts, such as guestbooks, shoutboxes, status/mood widgets, and even hit
        counters.
        <img aria-hidden="true" src="../assets/img/inline/sad.gif" />
      </p>

        The good news is that I found a way around that: you can use iframes. Specifially, you use the script you want to use on a different website not hosted on Neocities (instead hosted on e.g.
        github pages), in the center of an otherwise blank page with <i>background: transparent;</i> and then use this URL in an iframe on your neocities page.
        <a href="https://petracoding.github.io/neocities/stats.html" target="_blank">Here</a> you can see an example of what an otherwise blank page with a widget may look like.

        For guestbooks I recommend using <a href="https://www.smartgb.com/" target="_blank">smartgb</a> (which is what I use for <a href="/guestbook.html">my guestbook</a> iframe) because it is very
        customizable and looks good in an iframe. For a chatbox you can use <a href="https://www.cbox.ws/" target="_blank">cbox</a>, because it works via an iframe.
