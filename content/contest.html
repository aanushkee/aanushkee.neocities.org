  <h1>Contest</h1>
  <p style="font-size: 2em"><b>HI THIS PAGE IS WORK IN PROGRESS, PLEASE IGNORE IT!</b></p>
  <p>
    I see so many beautiful, interesting, unique, and helpful websites on the indie web, and I had the idea of celebrating the more unknown ones by creating a contest! I'm sure I'm not the first one
    to do this, I don't claim this as my original idea... I just thought it would be fun!
  </p>

  <h2>Participation Rules</h2>
  <ul class="list-with-more-spacing">
    <li>
      <b>Your website should be coded by you.</b>
      <ul>
        <li>No social media profiles, carrds, etc.</li>
        <li>No AI-generated code or content.</li>
        <li>
          <b>No out-of-the-box layouts/templates are allowed.</b> However, layouts based on those basic templates generated in layout generators or similar tools are allowed as long as you've added
          your own touch to them by changing the code. This means they shouldn't look like the default output of the layout generator you used.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Your website should be (at least mostly) finished.</b> This means you should have at least 2 subpages with content. Homepages with no working links in the navigation do not count as finished.
    </li>
    <li>Your website can be <b>hosted anywhere</b>; it does not have to be hosted on Neocities.</li>
    <li>
      If you have a concrete follower count of your website (e.g. on Neocities or Nekoweb) please only participate if you have <b>fewer than 150 followers</b>. Similarly, if you don't have a concrete
      follower count but know that you have a very popular site, please do not participate, as the point of this contest is to give "unknown gems" a chance to shine!
    </li>
    <li>No hate content or discrimination of any kind. If I see such content on your site you will be disqualified.</li>
    <li>No corporate websites, CVs, etc. This contest is for indie websites.</li>
    <li>Thanks for reading the rules! To participate, use the <a href="https://forms.gle/X7pzKXZ3hKfgyitB8" target="_blank">form</a>.</li>
    <li>Don't vote for yourself.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you're not sure, just shoot me a message or just participate anyway - I will check each website.</p>

  <h2>Evaluation</h2>

  <p></p>

  <p>There will be 3 winners (or 5 winners if there are more than 100 participants) in each category. There is no ranking inside the winners, so there is no 1st, 2nd...</p>

  <p>The categories are:</p>

  <ul class="list-with-more-spacing">
    <li><b>Voter's choice:</b> The sites with the most votes received win.</li>
    <li>
      <b>Petra's choice:</b> I decide which ones I like best. :D I will decide by rating your website on a scale of 0-5 concerning
      <b>content, visuals/aesthetic, responsiveness, accessability, code quality</b> (I will look at your source code). The ones with the highest sum of points are the winners.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    A website can only win in one of the categories, not both. This means I won't choose the winners of voter's choice for my own category. (But I might mention it if you would have been my pick, so
    you know!)
  </p>
  <hr />

  <h2>Prizes</h2>

  <p>
    There are no physical prizes, but your website will be <b>featured on this page</b> in perpetuity once the winners are decided, and you can feel really proud of yourself! Every winner will get a
    little <b>winner badge</b> for their website (in the form of a 88x31 button and a bigger graphic). As a bonus, every winner can <b>request</b> any kind of tutorial/resource/page/content from me
    (though I obviously can't promise that I will be able to do it, but I will try).
  </p>
  <p>If you're <b>interested in offering a prize</b> - no matter how small or silly - please contact me, we'll make it happen!</p>
