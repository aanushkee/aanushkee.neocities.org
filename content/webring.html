  <h2>Widget Code</h2>
  <p>Putting this code on your page will render the webring widget:</p>
  <textarea style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 1em" class="code-textarea" name="" id="" rows="10" aria-label="Webring Code">TODO ADD</textarea>

  <p>The widget will look like this:</p>
  <br />

  <div>
    <a href="https://petrapixel.neocities.org/webring"><b>Resource Webring</b></a
    ><br />
    <a href="https://petrapixel.neocities.org/webring?action=previous">[ prev ]</a>
    <a href="https://petrapixel.neocities.org/webring?action=random">[ random ]</a>
    <a href="https://petrapixel.neocities.org/webring?action=next">[ next ]</a>
  </div>

  <br />

  <p>You may style the widget however you want. You can remove the <i>random</i> link, but please don't remove the <i>previous</i>, <i>next</i> or webring links.</p>

      other people's resources doesn't count, you need to have created something yourself.
