  <h2>Code</h2>
  <p>Putting this code on your page will render the webring widget:</p>
  <textarea style="width: 100%" class="code-textarea" name="" id="" rows="10" aria-label="Webring Code"></textarea>

  <div class="webringu">
    <a href="/webring">Webringu</a>
    <a href="/webring?slug=YOURSLUGHERE&action=previous">PREV</a>
    <a href="/webring?slug=YOURSLUGHERE&action=random">RANDOM</a>
    <a href="/webring?slug=YOURSLUGHERE&action=next">NEXT</a>
  </div>

  <p>You need to change the slug (see form below).</p>
  <p>Please put the code on your website <b>before</b> filling out the form below. It will say "This site isn't part of the webring yet." until I've added you.</p>
  <p>You may style it however you want. You can remove the Random link, but please don't remove the Previous or Next links.</p>
